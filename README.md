## Abstract

Multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) is a key enabling technology for the next generation of wireless communication systems. A flexible MIMO scheme design could impact the performance of systems with hardware limitations. This paper presents a deep learning (DL)-based signal detection strategy for MIMO communication systems. More specifically, a preprocessing stage is added to label the input signals conveniently, improving the overall system performance. Based on this strategy, two novel schemes are proposed and evaluated considering the bit error rate (BER) and detection complexity. The performance of the proposed schemes is compared with the conventional one-hot scheme and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Results show that the proposed schemes achieve near-optimal BER performance offering different complexity tradeoffs while reaching a classification performance F1-score of 0.97. The proposed strategy may be useful in adaptive systems with limited computational resources.
